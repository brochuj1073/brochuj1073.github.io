<!--Paragraph of a fact about space-->
<h2>Amazing fact</h2>
<p>
  It may seem that we know a fair amount about outer space, but it is really just a penny in the ocean.<br> All the stars, galaxies, planets and other matter that can be detected only make up 4%, with the other 96%<br> being what cannot be seen, detected or even understood by astronomers.<br>
   Twenty-three percent of the mass of the universe is called dark matter, and we know about this because its gravity pulls on visible stars and galaxies.<br> This stuff is baffling enough, but 73% of the mass of the universe is dark energy, and this is something that scientists are stumped by.<br>
    This has repulsive gravity, and is believed to be the reason that the universe is accelerating in its expansion, instead of expanding at the same rate throughout<br> time or slowing down.
     This makes it one of the most baffling and mind-melting mysteries out there.

<!--Earths location-->
 <h2>Earths location in the Milky Way</h2>

<p>
    Earth is located in a spiral arm named the Orion arm. With a distance of 26,000-28,000 light-years from the center of the milky way.<br>
     You may think earth itself is in the middle of the milky way, but you'll be amazed to learn that it is on the edge of the milky way galaxy.
